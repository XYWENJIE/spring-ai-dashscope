# spring-ai-dashscope
Spring AI aliyun dashscope

Considering China’s unique national conditions (you know what I mean), this project aims to customize and extend for domestic cloud service providers, so as to effectively invoke AI models on domestic cloud servers using the Spring AI framework.

Notice: Due to the fact that Spring AI is still in its early stages, many package structures and interfaces are under exploration by the Spring official team; therefore, the project may not necessarily run smoothly.

As a programmer with 10 years of experience, I rarely use many new features. This project is based on my experience developing Spring AI within the company. Now that there are no historical burdens, I am referring to the official documentation for the latest feature implementations.
